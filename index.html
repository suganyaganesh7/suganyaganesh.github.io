                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Bharatanatyam, one of the oldest classical dance forms of India, has a rich and fascinating history. Its roots can be traced back to 
            the ancient temples of Tamil Nadu, where it was performed as a form of devotional art.
            The history of Bharatanatyam is closely intertwined with the history of the country itself, reflecting various cultural, social, and 
            religious influences over the centuries. Originally known as "Dasi Attam" or "Sadhir," Bharatanatyam was performed by temple dancers 
            known as "devadasis." These dancers were 
            dedicated to serving the deity of the temple through music, dance, and rituals. Over time, Bharatanatyam evolved and flourished under royal 
            patronage, particularly during the Chola dynasty in the 10th century. It underwent significant transformations during this period, incorporating 
            elements of music, literature, and sculpture into its repertoire. During the colonial era, Bharatanatyam faced suppression and stigma due to 
            misconceptions about its association with temple rituals and the devadasi system. However, efforts by pioneers such as E. Krishna Iyer and 
            Rukmini Devi Arundale led to its revival and renaissance in the early 20th century. Today, Bharatanatyam is celebrated worldwide as 
            a powerful art form that embodies the rich cultural heritage and spiritual traditions of India. It continues to evolve and thrive, 
            captivating audiences with its grace, beauty, and expressive storytelling.</p>

                <h2>About Bharatam</h2>
                <p>Bharatanatyam is a classical Indian dance form that originated in the temples of Tamil Nadu, South India. It is one of the oldest <br>
            and most revered classical dance traditions in India.The word "Bharatanatyam" is derived from the two Sanskrit words 
            "Bharata" (referring to the ancient Indian sage Bharata Muni, author of the Natya Shastra, a treatise on performing arts) and "Natya" (meaning dance).
            Thus, Bharatanatyam can be translated as the "dance of Bharata."Bharatanatyam is characterized by its intricate footwork, 
            hand gestures (mudras), facial expressions (abhinaya), and body moments.It is a highly expressive art form that narrates stories 
            from Hindu mythology, epics, and other classical Indian literature. Traditionally, Bharatanatyam was performed as a solo dance 
            by female dancers known as "devadasis" in the temples of Tamil Nadu.It was an integral part of temple rituals and worship, with dancers
            serving as the medium to convey devotion and express spiritual themes.</p>

                <h2>Bascis</h2>
                <p>Bharatanatyam is characterized by its distinct movements, gestures, and expressions, all of which contribute to its beauty and grace.
                    Here are some key aspects of Bharatanatyam:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Adavus:</strong> Adavus are the basic steps in Bharatanatyam. They include various movements of the feet, legs, hands, and body.
                Adavus are practiced and perfected by dancers to develop agility, balance, and precision.</li>
            <li><strong>Mudras:</strong> Mudras are hand gestures used in Bharatanatyam to convey meanings and emotions. There are hundreds of mudras,
                each representing different objects, actions, or feelings. Mudras are an essential component of Bharatanatyam's vocabulary.</li>
            <li><strong>Abhinaya:</strong> Abhinaya refers to the expressive aspect of Bharatanatyam, where dancers convey emotions, stories, and characters
                through facial expressions, body language, and gestures. Abhinaya requires deep understanding, sensitivity, and skillful portrayal.</li>
            <li><strong>Rasa:</strong> Rasa, meaning essence or flavor, is central to Bharatanatyam. Dancers strive to evoke specific emotions or sentiments (rasas)<br> 
                in their performances, such as love (shringara), heroism (vira), compassion (karuna), and devotion (bhakti).</li>
            <li><strong>Costumes and Makeup:</strong> Bharatanatyam costumes typically include vibrant silk sarees for female dancers and dhotis or
                traditional attire for male dancers. Makeup, including elaborate hairstyles, facial adornments, and expressive eye makeup (kajal), 
                enhances the visual appeal and character portrayal.</li>
            <li><strong>Music and Instruments:</strong> Bharatanatyam is accompanied by live music, usually consisting of classical Carnatic music compositions. 
                Instruments such as the mridangam (percussion), flute, veena, and violin are commonly used in Bharatanatyam performances.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These are just a few of the fundamental aspects of Bharatanatyam. The art form is vast and encompasses a rich repertoire of movements, compositions, and techniques, making it a lifelong journey of learning and exploration for dancers.</p>
